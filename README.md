# WordWrapProject
The purpose of this project is to perform “word wrapping” on unstructured text. Word wrapping is the process of converting very long lines and very short lines into columns of approximately uniform width. 
The program is created in eclipe and written in Java SE 11.
The program compiles, but there is a problem at times with the resizing of the inputed text.
